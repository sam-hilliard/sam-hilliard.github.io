        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
            WebDev Alliance is a startup that aims to bring developers, designers, 
            and marketers together to deliver web applications to clients. 
            Let’s face it, freelancing for the web can be a daunting task. 
            It takes a lot of time, effort, and experience to be able to develop and design web 
            applications by yourself and consistently bring in clients. Working at WebDev Alliance allows you to reap 
            all the benefits of being a freelancer (flexible hours and freedom) without having to bear all of the workload yourself.

        <h2>Why Join a Startup?</h2>
        <p>
            Many people perceive joining a startup as a risky venture. However, that’s not usually 
            the case, especially with WebDev Alliance. The only capital required are laptops and brains, so there’s 
            no initial investment needed that might turn people away. There is also no need to worry about 
            relocation or quitting the job you might have now as hours are flexible and can be virtual or in person.
        </p>
        <p>
            In fact, joining a startup only has benefits. You have the option to be 
            part of something that can potentially take off and change the course of the rest of your life. 
            And if you don’t decide to stay, building experience in your field and having a leadership position 
            will open so many career opportunities for you in the future.
